In case you're experiencing weird glitch on the map, this may occur due to the lack of appropriate DLC(s). I would recommend checking if you've accidentally subscribed to certain DLC-dependent submods without owning that particular DLC from the https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1540696322. Otherwise, try unsub-then-resub from the Steam Workshop then try launching the game with it enabled again. If the issue still persists after that point then I'ld suggest disabling that particular submod for now, and verify the integrity of your HoI4 installation on your machine (if Steam) https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB or redownload HoI4 again for Xbox Pass Users.
